# Apprenticeship Patterns

### Summary

Using the patterns based model of learning about development, the authors have
done a great job of modeling an ideal journey of a developer apprentice through
the pages of this books.  In it, there are things that I've recommended to
others like John Gesimondo and Winston Yee.  Things like "Retreat into Competence" which
teaches that sometimes when you're stuck on something new, it's nice to fall
back on some of the things you're good at to launch your confidence and ability
into further forward progress.

Other great ideas such as being the worst on the team so you learn the most and
thereby forgoing title and salary progress to focus on building stronger skills.

Also, it goes through how you should get mentors and work with others side by
side to learn and grow more.  You can't learn everything from a book or blog
post.

### Key Patterns

##### Retreat into Competence

When feeling overwhelmed and confidence is shot, try to do some work in skills and technologies you know.  Try to ship something that makes you feel good about your abilities and drives you to feel good about taking on that new task.  __Action Item__: See how pitchers in baseball deal with bad outings.

##### Confront your ignorance

Pick one things that I'm going to focus on and actively work on building that skill.  Fill in the gaps of knowledge and work to get it routine.  Then start on the other pieces.  The breakable toy pattern is good here.  Similar to what I used to test out Apache Spark or Terraform, I should prototype things and get a better understanding of the tooling, process, and mindset.

##### Concrete Skills

Pick a set of skills that you can bring to the table that makes the team better.  This will help gain trust and get you through the interview process.  Things like going deep in your first language can help with this.

##### Craft over Art

You're being paid to add value not to make artwork.  Shipping is very important, but the right balance is possible.

##### Learn how you fail

Have a process to deal with failure.  The 5 whys is a perfect example of this.  How do you deal with a situation that was less than ideal?  Do you start blaming or start working to correct the problem and prevent it from happening in the future?

Things I could do to get better at this is know that I will fail and then have a good process of writing down what happened and what we can do to try and reduce the risk of it happening in the future.

##### Share what you learn

Basically write a blog or share the things I've learned.  Br0k is a great example of this!

##### Use the Source

Documentation is great, but reading the source code is better.  I've been able to push this on ruby but it would be great to also do this well in another language.  Sadly that means being able to understand a lot of the language idioms and oddities. But it could be totally worth it.

##### Stay in the trenches

Basically keep coding and don't stop.  Your ability to code provides a large amount of security as well as keep you in the loop with the folks you're working with.  ABC (Always Be Coding)
