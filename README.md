# My Learning Journey

I'm trying to document my journey of learning.  This is a pretty late start
since I'm 4 years into my professional software engineering career, but as
someone wise once told me, it's never too late.

I hope to document my new journey into Machine Learning and Deep Learning
especially as the topic is much harder and tricker than most.  Also, it'll
be more similar to the difficulties I had in learning software engineering
so I hope to apply some of the previous patterns as well as learn and unlearn
to become a more productive data person.
